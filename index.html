        User Story #12: Each element with the class of nav-link should contain text that corresponds to the header text within each section (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains the text "Hello world").

        User Story #13: When I click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the main-doc element (e.g. If I click on a nav-link element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a section element that has that id and contains the corresponding header.

      <p>Don't be scared. The things out there that are unknown aren't scary in themselves. They are just unknown at the 
        moment. Take the time to know them before you list them as scary. Then the world will be a much less scary place 
        for you.

      <p>Was it a whisper or was it the wind? He wasn't quite sure. He thought he heard a voice but at this moment all 
        he could hear was the wind rustling the leaves of the trees all around him. He stopped and listened more intently 
        to see if he could hear the voice again. Nothing but the wind rustling the leaves could be heard. 
        He was about to continue his walk when he felt a hand on his shoulder, and he quickly turned to see who it was. 
        There was nobody there, but he heard the voice again.

      <p>It had become a far too common an event in her life. He has specifically placed the key to the box in a 
        special place so that he wouldn't lose it and know exactly where it was when the key was needed. Now that 
        he needed to open the box, he had absolutely no idea where that special spot she placed the key might be.

      <p>I recently discovered I could make fudge with just chocolate chips, sweetened condensed milk, vanilla extract, 
        and a thick pot on slow heat. I tried it with dark chocolate chunks and I tried it with semi-sweet chocolate chips. 
        It's better with both kinds. It comes out pretty bad with just the dark chocolate. The best add-ins are crushed almonds
         and marshmallows -- what you get from that is Rocky Road. It takes about twenty minutes from start to fridge, 
         and then it takes about six months to work off the twenty pounds you gain from eating it. 
         All things in moderation, friends. All things in moderation.

      <p>The piano sat silently in the corner of the room. Nobody could remember the last time it had been played. 
        The little girl walked up to it and hit a few of the keys. The sound of the piano rang throughout the house for the 
        first time in years. In the upstairs room, confined to her bed, the owner of the house had tears in her eyes.

      <p>The water rush down the wash and into the slot canyon below. Two hikers had started the day to sunny weather 
        without a cloud in the sky, but they hadn't thought to check the weather north of the canyon. Huge thunderstorms 
        had brought a deluge o rain and produced flash floods heading their way. The two hikers had no idea what was coming.

      <p>Stormi is a dog. She is dark grey and has long legs. Her eyes are expressive and are able to let her humans know 
        what she is thinking. Her tongue is long, pink, and wet. Her long legs allow her to sprint after other dogs, people or 
        bunnies. She can be a good dog, but also very bad. Her tail wags when happy or excited and hides between her back legs 
        when she is bad. Stormi is a dog I love.

      <p>The headphones were on. They had been utilized on purpose. She could hear her mom yelling in the background, 
        but couldn't make out exactly what the yelling was about. That was exactly why she had put them on. She knew her 
        mom would enter her room at any minute, and she could pretend that she hadn't heard any of the previous yelling.

      <p>Wandering down the path to the pond had become a daily routine. Even when the weather wasn't cooperating like today 
        with the wind and rain, Jerry still took the morning stroll down the path until he reached the pond. Although there 
        didn't seem to be a particular reason Jerry did this to anyone looking in from the outside, those who knew him well 
        knew exactly what was going on. It could all be traced back to a specific incident that happened exactly 5 years 
        previously.

      <p>It seemed like it should have been so simple. There was nothing inherently difficult with getting the project done. 
        It was simple and straightforward enough that even a child should have been able to complete it on time, but that 
        wasn't the case. The deadline had arrived and the project remained unfinished.
